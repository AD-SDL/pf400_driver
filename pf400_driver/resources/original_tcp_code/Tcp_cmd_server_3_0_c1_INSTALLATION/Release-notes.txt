Release notes for TCP Command Server
Updated May 27, 2021

TCP Command Server 3.0C1, May 27, 2021

	o Add support for dual servoed gripper.  Detected by the &H80 bit being
	  set in DataID 2003 "Axis mask" for PF400 or PF300.
	  In dual gripper mode, some safe locations are different.

	o New command "SetActiveGripper <gripper> <spin> <profile>"
	  selects current gripper.  

	o New command "GetActiveGripper" returns the selected gripper number.

	o In dual gripper mode, the return values for the IsFullyClosed
	  command have changed.

TCP Command Server 3.0B3, January 27, 2021

	o In HeightDetect command, reduce time delay after height detect
	  triggered.

TCP Command Server 3.0B2, December 14, 2020

	o Fix bug preventing load/save of pallet info in .gpo file.  Gives
	  error -707 when you attempt to load saved data or reload project.

TCP Command Server 3.0B1, May 14, 2020

	o Fix bug so that WaitForEOM properly detects "timeout nulling errors"
	  in the previous motion.
	o In command Catch block, remap async errors if possible.
	o Add missing constants to PARobot_auto_center.gpl that cause compile
	  errors when used in standalone applications.
	o Add optional argument to DestC and DestJ commands.  If omitted or 0,
	  behavior is the same as before.  If specified as 1, the actual
	  destination values are returned, regardless of whether or not the
	  robot is moving.

TCP Command Server 3.0A7, May 30, 2019

	o In Z-height detection, added save/restore/change of "Max negative
	  PID limit" (10352).  
	  During process, increase PID limit to avoid generating bogus
	  error when using new GPL versions.
	o Added special AC_Force_Filter routine that can adjust the single
	  pole filter that is applied to all force readings during the
	  Height Detection method.

TCP Command Server 3.0A6, August 10, 2018

	o Add Payload command.

TCP Command Server 3.0A5, October 17, 2017

	o Add check for initialization to PARobot_auto_center.gpl routines.
	  Return -320 if not initialized.
	o Enhance "pc" command to allow string DataIDs to be written.

TCP Command Server 3.0A4, April 4, 2016

	o Fix bug in loading angles locations.  Values were read as all 0's.

TCP Command Server 3.0A3, September 3, 2015

	Major enhancements for version 3.0

	o Added Station class to hold location and reference frame info.
	o Converted all instructions to use stations.
	o Location and profile indices now start at 1 instead of 0 so that
	  general commands and PARobot commands use the same index values.
	o Added support for pallets in PARobot.  Added new instructions:
	  PalletOrigin, PalletX, PalletY, PalletZ, PalletIndex,
	  StationType, StationLoc
	o Changed plug-in hooks to return Reply
	o Update file load/store to handle stations.
	  Remove UpdateFile command.  Add StoreFile.
	o Removed explicit N_LOC and N_PROF references in code to allow
	  dynamic arrays.  Change default number of locations to 20.
	o Removed locidx and profidx instructions.
	  Added location index and profile index arguments to all instructions
	  that used current location or current profile.

	o Fix bug in Rail command.  Returned spurious "1" in PC mode.
	o Added support for PF300.
	o Fixed Cmd_MoveToSafe, Cmd_ChangeConfig, Cmd_ChangeConfig2 to not
	  generate an error if a non-servo gripper is being used.

TCP Command Server 2.1A2, May 12, 2015

	o Fix bug in sFormat causes exception for large values.
	o Correct license error message in PF400_auto_center.gpl
	o Upgraded PF400 routines to support PP100 robot.
	o For the PP100, the following functions are disabled: Cmd_MoveToSafe,
	  Cmd_ChangeConfig, Cmd_ChangeConfig2, Cmd_PickPlate with horizontal,
	  stations, Cmd_PlacePlate with horizontal stations,
	  Cmd_HomeAll_IfNoPlate, Cmd_IsFullyClosed, Cmd_HeightDetect.
	o For the PP100, all rail operations are ignored.
	o Generalize PF400 plug-in for all robots rather than PF400.
	o Rename PF400* files to PARobot*.
	o Fix format of tcs.gpo so that GDE editor works properly.
	o Change MIN_SFTSTP from 75 to 73 to increase squeeze force.
	o Add support for multiple status threads.
	  Change "OpenStatusPort" to NumStatusPorts.  Default is 1.

TCP Command Server 2.0B9, August 01, 2014

	o Fix bug in Class_StringList.gpl GetList only returned 1st item
	  in list due to GPL bug.  Only affects serial command interface.
	o Added AC_HorizCompliance2 that permits a bias torque to be
	  added to each axis during horizontal compliance mode.  This
	  was implemented because axes sometimes need a small holding
	  torque to maintain position and turning off all torques
	  sometimes resulted in axes twitching into a natural position.
	o Added optional argument to PickPlate and PlacePlate commands
	  to support torque bias feature of AC_HorizCompliance2.

TCP Command Server 2.0B8, February 06, 2014

	o Add optional 7th parameter to movec to allow config to be set.

TCP Command Server 2.0B7, August 26, 2013

	o Updated Z-height detection to eliminate up to 5 sec delay that
	  occurred if the Z axis traveled its full length before finding
	  a surface.

TCP Command Server 2.0B6, July 21,2013

	o Fix bug preventing storing angles locations via UpdateFile.
	o Updated force grip routines to permit both closing to grasp a plate,
	  and now, also permitting opening to grasp a plate.
	o Updated Z-height detection routines.
	o Fixed bug in Cmd_PickPlate/Cmd_PlacePlate that incorrectly 
	  repositioned jt 4 when trying to center axis to within +-180 
	  degrees during the approach motion.  Could be off by 180 degrees.

TCP Command Server 2.0B5. November 05, 2012

	o Fix bug in PF400 where profiles moderate_sl and fast_sl were set
	  to ji motion.
	o HereC command now saves current robot configuration.

	  generator is idle or in jog mode.
	o Add ChangeConfig2 command with new algorithm to change configuration.
	o Added config to WhereC outputs
	o Added Auto Center routines for PF400.
	  Currently, only the HeightDetect function is supported.
	o Fixed bug in PickPlate and PlacePlate when using rail.
	  Location.Kinesol does not compensate for rail position.
	o Add horizontal compliance option to PickPlate and PlacePlate.

	o Add MoveOneAxis and MoveExtraAxis to base module.
	o Add Rail, MoveRail, and GraspData commands to PF400.
